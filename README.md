# CareerSwipe Project Setup


## Step 1: Clone the Repository  

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```
  

Then, navigate into the project folder:  

```sh
cd CareerSwipe
```

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment  

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

This will create a folder named `.venv` in your project directory.  

## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment  
 

### On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):  
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```


Once activated, you should see `(.venv)` appear at the beginning of your command line prompt. This indicates that you are working inside the virtual environment.  

## Step 4: Install Project Dependencies  

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Step 5: Run the Application  

```sh
flask run
```
